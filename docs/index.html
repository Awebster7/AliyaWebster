        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Aliya Webster, I am currently a first year student at Penn State Behrend. My major is currently undecided but I am interested in Digital Media and Marketing. I grew up enjoying all things art and after entering high school, I ended up taking 5 art courses in total. One of those courses included AP Art, where all my projects followed a concentration of my choice. In AP Art where I focused on 2-D drawing, I grew to love the process of having a plan or idea and then making it come to life. This class helped me realize that I wanted to design and create in my future career. I wanted to make visual pieces that move people. Now Iâ€™m trying to find the career that will allow me to realize that dream. This website is being used to try out my new skills that I learn while in the Digit 100 course here at Behrend. I am excited to use my eye for design to develop and discover the interworking of a website.
