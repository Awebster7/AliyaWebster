        <h1> Reflection on Two Different Approaches to Website Development</h1>
         <p>
             After trying and working with both GitHub Pages and Penn State’s WordPress, I learned a lot about Website Development. Both tools have their own pros and cons and I think they're both great tools. I personally like the look of how my WordPress came out compared to my GitHub Pages even though I did find GitHub to be easier to navigate. I enjoyed this assignment and feel like I now have a good foundation for this class.  
             As I said above, both development methods had their challenges. For GitHub Pages, I think its biggest challenge was trying to get the page to lay out in the visual way you want to see. GitHub deals with the code and whatever you put in is what you will see unlike WordPress where they lay it out more for you. I have never worked with code before this class, so I think the learning the basics of coding along with trying to build a website on GitHub was challenging at times. In GitHub, just figuring out the structure of code is tough at times. For WordPress, on the other hand, I think the most significant challenge is trying to find where you must go to get the structure of the website right. WordPress is like a maze in the sense that it’s hard to go back to the place you have already been especially for a beginner because if you have never used the site, it is easy to get frustrated. 
             An advantage that I would say that GitHub has is that you know what your results are going to be for the most part. It's also super easy to look up HTML online if you need help with the advantage being that it's more hands on. In general, it is just much easier to figure out compared to WordPress. One advantage for WordPress was that I found that it was much easier to create a more professional look to your website. Another advantage to WordPress is that it helped you to navigate any grammar issues whereas GitHub did not. I think my GitHub Pages looked very simple and it was hard to get it where I liked how they looked. If you know what you are doing on WordPress, I think it's an easier process. For modifying the layout and organization, I liked WordPress. Once I got the basics of WordPress, I found it was visually more appealing like I would want it to look. I went through 3 or 4 different layouts until I found the one I liked the best. For GitHub since I don’t know a lot about coding, the layout ended up being very plain and it was harder for me to present it the way I wanted to.  
             It helped to start with GitHub Pages because I thought it was more difficult to understand than WordPress. The skills that are necessary are to learn the basic coding layout and to know what sources to use and where to go for help. Dr. B gave us some of those great sources to find code and help us with our websites. You must learn that it's ok to look up code you don’t remember because it's hard to remember everything. Patience is also a good skill to develop when dealing with both sites, especially if you're working with them for the first time. I look forward to having the chance to practice coding and improve my skills with using it and create a more professional looking GitHub website. I would also like to figure out more of what WordPress has to offer that I am not aware of. Overall, I think WordPress is more aesthetically pleasing but I had a fun time developing both pieces.</p>
