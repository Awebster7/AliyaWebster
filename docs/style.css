/* ebb: This is a comment in CSS: 
 * Notice that the properties I set on the <body> element get passed down to elements inside it. So all my text is the color and font that I set here. 
 * If I want to change the styling of internal elements, I can just enter their names and apply CSS properties to them, following CSS syntax.
